/// Lets desktop users go back with the keyboard and the mouse (GitHub #138).
///
/// On Windows, macOS and Linux, `Esc` and the mouse "back" side button pop the page the focus is in, exactly like
/// the back button in its app bar. Nothing happens when that page is the first of its navigator (the homepage
/// tabs), so the app is never closed by accident.
///
/// Sitting between the app's shortcuts and the navigator, this widget sees `Esc` before the app does, so it steps
/// aside whenever somebody closer to the focus owns the key:
///
/// * A dialog, popup menu or modal bottom sheet is not a page route: the key goes on to the route's own dismiss
///   action, which closes it when its barrier is dismissible.
/// * A focused text input keeps the key: the text editing shortcuts of the app stop it, and editors implementing
///   [TextInputClient] (the BBCode editor) are skipped here too, so typing in the search box or the editor never
///   leaves the page.
///
/// A persistent bottom sheet (the expanded reply editor) is a local history entry of its page, so the pop closes
/// the sheet first and the page only on the next press. Pages refusing to pop (an unsaved draft asking first) keep
/// deciding through their `PopScope`.
///
/// On other platforms this widget only builds [child].
